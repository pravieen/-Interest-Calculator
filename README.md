# Interest calculator 

 Flutter project
 

I've developed a new app called "Interest Calculator" which can calculate the interest of an investment.

As a college student, I have a lot of friends who are obsessed with making money. They always ask me questions like "Hey, if I invest $X in this company and it doubles in 3 months, how much will it be?" or "If I put $X into the stock market for 10 years and it gains 5% every year, how much will I make?"

for this, I have come up with a solution.
